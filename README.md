## Todo
- [x] better animations for the slider
- [x] rotate queue on next instead of changing index (ended up switching to a VecDeque)
- [x] playlists page
- [x] fix that weird stutter when adding songs.
- [x] add ability to replace queue with playlists (ie. Load a playlist as a queue)
- [x] hot reloadable themes (ended up using a toml config file watched by notify)
- [ ] add ability to add songs to playlists from the search menu
- [ ] add ability to create and delete playlists
- [ ] figure out a better way to cache images that is not as ram hungry. Scale down?
