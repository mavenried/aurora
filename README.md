## Todo

- [ ] add ability to add songs to playlists from the search menu
- [ ] add ability to create and delete playlists

## To Fix

- [ ] go back to deleting from queue based on index. filtering out based on id will break when duplicates of same song exist in queue. could result in undocumented behaviour
